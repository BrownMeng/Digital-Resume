    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <p>
        I am a highly motivated individual with an interest in all things technology. having undertaken a integrated masters of electrical and electronic engineering i developed a keen sense for human-centric design within technology. This developed due to a frustration with the way the materials werre being presented with a clear lack of consideration towards the bigger picture and inspired me to follow my own idealogoy whilst retaining the foundemental principles behind the requirements. As such i am a hardworking and passionate individual that aspires to push conventional boundaries to develop not only myself but those around me as well.

    <h3>Noteable Achievements:</h3>
        <p>
            During my undergraduate degree i worked towards the development of a novel design of a home phototherapy unit for neonatal jaundice. this involved not only the physical system design and testing but also the operating software and the considerations of the intended user in respect of the method of interaction. <br>
            During my integrated masters year I was an integral part of a research and design team leading a project for a net zero development. which combined the renewable energy sources, energy management systems and use of smart technology. during which time i developed operational algorithms and complex mathematical modeling systems to demonstrate the impacts of the project and to simplify the design specifications to the optimal conditions.
